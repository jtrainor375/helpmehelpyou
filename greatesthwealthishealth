You have to tep back and look at the big picture sometimes in the ever going, "Pursut of Success".  Some say success is
only a scallable measure of emotions.  Others easily relate it to such things as achieveing a certain goal, or the 
pinnacle of their life.  However do reember one key thing success is not only measured and reached in life but only 
attainable if your around to answer the previous statment.  You can have all the money in the world, howver have the 
hands come down and take you away as fast as i type this email.  Coming fom a man whom has cnducted two tours in the
war in special operations, i agree with both conotations.  As to ive stared death in the eyes numerous times, an easy
scalable relation to success, however never topped me from winding up broke and in dept over 200,000.00 at the now age
of 32.  So i say if the Adult obesity rate is on the rise, now due to people simply getting laid off and falling into
a depression is it really precieved as the greatest wealth?  Or can oe make the statement that both are equal n a way
that the greatest health is Wealth, as to Wealth is to health.
